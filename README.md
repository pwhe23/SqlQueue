SqlQueue
========

SqlQueue is a simple example of how you can use a table in SqlServer as a job queue. It can handle multiple consumers all pulling from the queue at the same time. To test simply, run the SqlProducer exe to create jobs and as many SqlConsumers instances as you want to run the jobs.
